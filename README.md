This script is an example of a Bayesian Logistic Regression from a classification problem of Heart Failure: This dataset is the most complete heart disease dataset available for research purposes, created by combining five individual datasets (Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and Stalog) with a total of 918 observations. The dataset contains 11 independent variables, including five categorical and six numerical features. The primary goal of this dataset is to predict heart disease events based on the given clinical features.
